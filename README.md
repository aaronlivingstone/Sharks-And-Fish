This project was completed as part of coursework for CS61B at the University of California, Berkeley.

This project is an implementation of a simulation of an ocean containing sharks and fish. Also implementing code to convert an ocean into a run-length encoding and back. The ocean is rectangular, but the edges are connected together in a topological donut or torus. This means that the top (North) and bottom (South) edges are considered adjacent, so if you start at the top edge and go up, you'll be at the bottom edge. Similarly, the East and West edges are connected.
